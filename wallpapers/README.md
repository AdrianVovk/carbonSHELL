# Wallpapers
This folder will eventually contain something that isn't stolen, but right now for testing it doesn't.

The wallpaper comes from elementary OS (which got it from SpaceX), and the album art is from an album called `Jamie Lidell` that I found on Google images.

This will eventually contain only wallpapers and a nix file to handle installing and setting them up with NixOS. To get some of the wallpapers, I'll definitely be emailing SpaceX trying to get some awesome shots.
